# Problem statements

# **Parking a lot-**

      -Design a parking lot system to support N cars/bikes.

     -Parking lot has a number associated,which increases as we go  far from entry point and                           start with 1.  

-Automated ticketing should happen

-when a car comes we take color of the car and registration number of the car

-We assign the nearest parking lot and also allow leaving the car from that lot

-once the car leaves we mark the slot available again

-A bike can be parked in any nearest empty spot

-A car can only be parked in the nearest empty car spot

-There are configurable number of slots  for electric cars and bikes also

-On exit user should be able to pay via cash/card/fasttag

-support of multiple floors

-pricing per hour for cars and bikes

## ***Functionalities support***

       -Given a vehicle we should be able to park it and get the ticket

      - Given a vehicle we should be able to unpark it and pay

      -Given a spot you should be able to find the vehicle parked in it.

      -Given a vehicle number find the slot in which it is parked

      -return registration number of all cars of a particular color

     -return all slots/spots numbers where cars of particular color is parked
